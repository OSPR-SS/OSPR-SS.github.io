## World's first Open Source Paper Review

Research and Development is one of the most important sectors of society. Every organization has it's own special R&D department. It basically focuses on researching various existing systems and papers, and then applying pre-existing knowledge along with innovation to create something new for the society. 

Our focus is to review as many research papers as possible, and write an Open Source Review Paper on the existing papers along with proper citation to the source, which will help us gather all the valuable informations into one place. The reviews posted here are not published in any Journals, and will remain as Open Source.

P.S.: The review Papers are not Peer reviewed. Do include proper citation to our review posts whenever you use them in your blogs or researches. Interactions, constructive critism and discussions are welcome in the comments section of the review posts.
