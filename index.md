## World's first Open Source Paper Review

Research and Development is one of the most important sectors of society. Every organization has it's own special R&D department. It basically focuses on researching various existing systems and papers, and then applying pre-existing knowledge along with innovation to create something new for the society. 

Our focus is to review as many research papers as possible, and write a sort-of Review paper on the existing papers along with proper citation to the source, which will help gather all the valuable informations into one place.

To be added soon...
